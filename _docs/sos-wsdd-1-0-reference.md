# **Deprecation Notice** 

**Notice:** This convention has been deprecated due to IOOS' transition from the OGC SOS/SWE suite of standards to [ERDDAP](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap) for in situ data dissemination.  

All relevant guidance in this standard has been superceded as of the **2020-01-10** publication date of the [IOOS Metadata Profile 1.2](https://ioos.github.io/ioos-metadata/).  Please refer to the IOOS Metadata Profile for current guidance.

The information below is retained for historical reference purposes only.


# **Glossary**

Term | Definition
:-----| :--------
Consumers| In this document, “Consumers” refer to any systems that need to obtain weather data from SOS and connect via a web service interface.
Service|The IT realization of some self-contained business functionality. An implementation – independent reusable operational function that may be discovered as self-describing interfaces, and invoked using open standard protocols across networks.
Service Discovery | The processes through which a service consumer may search for and find services, (generally done by providing criteria to search for against a corpus of service metadata which service providers have provided to describe their services).
Service Oriented  Architecture (SOA) | A paradigm for organizing and utilizing distributed capabilities of services to clients that may be under the control of different ownership domains.  SOA provides a uniform means to offer, discover, interact with and use capabilities to produce desired effects consistent with measurable preconditions and expectations
Service Registration | The registering process for the agreed service.
Service Registry | An enabling infrastructure service that uses a formal registration process to store, catalog, and manage metadata relevant to the services. A registry supports the search, identification, and understanding of resources, as well as query capabilities.
Stateful Dialogues | Dialogues that have “state” information between participating server and consumer agents to invoke requests and responses.
Subscribe|To request data via the Broker from a publisher on a particular subject or topic.
Taxonomy | A collection of controlled vocabulary terms organized into a hierarchical structure or categorization. Each term in taxonomy is in one or more parent-child relationships to other terms in the taxonomy.
Observation | A value measured at given time instant (e.g. value: 0.2, time: 08-11-2012 12:12), and represented according to the O&M standard data model.
Procedure | A process that indicates who provide the observations. For SOS this is generally the sensor, but may also be a generic process that leads to some observations and is represented as SensorML standard data model.
Observed Property | A physical phenomenon that is observed (e.g. phenomenon: water temperature), and is represented with a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) composed by colon separated text according to the `<om:observedProperty>` element of the O&M standard.
Feature of Interest | A feature that relates to the observations, and represented according to the `<om:featureOfInterest>` element of the O&M standard. For in-situ observation, the feature of interest is the instrument (sensor) location, while for remote observation it is the location of the target.
Offering | A collection of sensors used to conveniently group them up (e.g. network:all, network:all-temperature, sensor:watertemp, etc.) and is represented as `<sos:ObservationOffering>` element of the SOS standard.
